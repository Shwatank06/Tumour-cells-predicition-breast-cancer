Classification and Prediction of Tumour cells Breast Cancer 
The dataset is given by Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostics. It includes the measurements from the digitized images of needle aspirate of breast mass tissue.

The data has 569 samples of cancer biopsies with 32 features. From these features, we can predict whether the tumours are benign or malignant.

1. Data Preparation by checking the target variable and removing the ID variable.
2. Visualization of the frequency of the type variable.
3. Normalizing the variables by using min-max normalizations and z-score methods.
4. Bifurcation of train and test sets.
5. Prediction of the type of tumours using KNN classification algorithms.
6. Improving the models using different values of k and other methods of normalizations.
